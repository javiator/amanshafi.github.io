# Simple Independent Blog Framework

## Overview

This document outlines a streamlined framework for organizing blog content as **independent, shareable posts** that can cover any technical topic while maintaining professional presentation and easy discovery. The framework prioritizes content flexibility over complex project dependencies.

## Core Philosophy

- **Independent Posts**: Each post stands alone and can be shared without context
- **Content-Focused**: Posts about any technical topic, not tied to specific projects
- **Minimal Metadata**: Simple frontmatter for easy management
- **Professional Presentation**: Showcase technical expertise and learning
- **Easy Discovery**: Clear categorization and tagging for content discovery
- **Flexible Content Types**: Support any type of technical content
