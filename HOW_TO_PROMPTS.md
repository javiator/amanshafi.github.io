## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Prompt

1. **Generic Post**: Use for standalone content like tool reviews, general learning posts, or technology explorations
2. **New Project**: Use when starting a completely new evolutionary project with multiple planned phases
3. **Existing Evolution**: Use when adding posts to an already established evolutionary project

### Key Differences

- **Generic Post**: No evolution metadata, no project structure updates
- **New Project**: Creates entire project structure, updates homepage and projects page
- **Existing Evolution**: Updates existing project structure, maintains consistency

### Important Notes

- Always use the current date for new posts
- Follow the established naming convention for files
- Ensure all cross-references are updated
- Maintain consistency with existing project structure
- Include appropriate evolution context for project posts

### File Naming Convention

- Generic posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
- Project posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name-post-title.md`

### Evolution Status Indicators

- âœ… Complete: Evolution is finished
- ðŸ”„ Active: Currently working on this evolution
- ðŸ“‹ Planned: Future evolution
