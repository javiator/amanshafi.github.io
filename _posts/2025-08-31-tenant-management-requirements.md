Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Today I'm documenting the requirements for a **Landlord-Tenant Management System** - a specialized application designed for individual landlords who manage their own properties and handle all aspects of tenant payments including rent, utilities, and maintenance.

This isn't your typical enterprise property management system. Instead, it's a practical tool for landlords who want to track their properties, tenants, and financial transactions all in one place.

## What We Plan to Create

A web-based landlord-tenant management application that allows individual landlords to:

- **Manage Properties**: Track all owned properties with complete CRUD operations
- **Manage Tenants**: Maintain tenant information and link them to specific properties
- **Track Transactions**: Record all financial transactions related to properties and tenants
- **View Financial Summary**: Get real-time payment status showing positive or negative balances

The application focuses on simplicity and clarity - making it easy for landlords to see the complete financial picture of their properties and tenant relationships at a glance.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Centralized Property Management**
   - Single place to manage all property information
   - Easy property creation, updates, and tracking
   - Quick overview of all owned properties

2. **Tenant Relationship Tracking**
   - Maintain comprehensive tenant records
   - Link tenants to their respective properties
   - Track tenant contract details and dates

3. **Comprehensive Financial Tracking**
   - Record all types of transactions (rent, utilities, maintenance, etc.)
   - Track both expenses and payments
   - Automatic calculation of current balances

4. **Clear Financial Visibility**
   - View transaction history at tenant level
   - View transaction history at property level
   - See current account status (positive/negative balance)
   - Identify who owes money or has credit

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Paginated views for easy navigation
   - Simple forms for data entry
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

### Technical Goals

- Build a maintainable single-file application (initial version)
- Use modern web technologies (Flask, React)
- Provide RESTful API for future extensibility
- Store data reliably using SQLite
- Support CSV/Excel exports for reporting
