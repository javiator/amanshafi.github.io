**Status**: üîÑ Active  
**Focus**: Enterprise patterns and Spring Boot migration  
**Technologies**: Java, Spring Boot, React, Docker, PostgreSQL  
**Posts**: 2 posts

## Evolution Overview

The third evolution focuses on **enterprise patterns** and **Spring Boot migration**. This evolution leverages Java's ecosystem depth and Spring's tooling to create a production-ready application with modern development practices.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Spring Boot Mastery**: Learning modern Spring Boot patterns and conventions
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Implementing production-ready patterns
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment and development
- **Database Migration**: Flyway migrations and schema management
- **Java Ecosystem**: Leveraging Java's rich ecosystem and tooling

## Posts in This Evolution
