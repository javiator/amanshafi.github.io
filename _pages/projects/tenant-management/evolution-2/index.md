**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Focus**: Clean architecture and separation of concerns  
**Technologies**: Python, Flask, FastAPI, React  
**Posts**: 2 posts

## Evolution Overview

The second evolution focused on **clean architecture** and **separation of concerns**. This modular monolith approach taught the importance of organized code structure while maintaining the benefits of a single deployable unit.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Modular Architecture**: Breaking down the single file into organized modules
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Implementing business logic separation
- **API Design**: Creating RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods
- **Frontend-Backend Separation**: React frontend with Python backend
- **Clean Code Principles**: Writing maintainable, testable code

## Key Learnings

1. **Clean Architecture**: Learned the importance of organized code structure
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Mastered business logic separation
3. **API Design**: Understood RESTful principles and HTTP methods
4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Learned React-Python communication
5. **Refactoring Techniques**: Gained experience in systematic code improvement
6. **Scalability Preparation**: Built foundation for future microservices

## Evolution Outcomes

This evolution successfully transformed the single-file application into a well-structured modular monolith. It demonstrated the importance of clean architecture while maintaining the benefits of a single deployable unit.

The modular approach provided a solid foundation for understanding enterprise patterns and prepared the codebase for the next evolution into Java/Spring Boot.
