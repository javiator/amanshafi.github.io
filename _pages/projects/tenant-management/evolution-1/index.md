**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Focus**: Rapid prototyping and learning fundamentals  
**Technologies**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy  
**Posts**: 1 post

## Evolution Overview

The first evolution focused on **rapid prototyping** and getting a working application up quickly. This single-file approach taught the fundamentals of web development while keeping complexity minimal.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Rapid Development**: Getting from idea to working application quickly
- **Full-Stack Fundamentals**: Understanding the complete web development stack
- **Database Design**: Learning SQLAlchemy and database relationships
- **User Interface**: Creating functional web interfaces with embedded templates

## Key Learnings

1. **Rapid Prototyping Value**: Single-file approach enabled quick iteration
2. **Full-Stack Understanding**: Learned how all layers work together
3. **Database Relationships**: Mastered one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
4. **User Experience**: Focused on creating functional, user-friendly interfaces
5. **Development Speed**: Appreciated the speed of single-file development

## Evolution Outcomes

This evolution successfully demonstrated that a functional application could be built quickly with minimal complexity. It provided the foundation for understanding the domain and identifying areas for improvement in subsequent evolutions.

The single-file approach, while not scalable, taught valuable lessons about rapid development and the importance of getting working software in users' hands quickly.
