Here are some of the projects I've been working on, showcasing my journey in full-stack development and enterprise architecture.

## 🎯 Journey Overview

Each project represents a complete learning journey, demonstrating both implementation skills and architectural thinking. These journeys showcase:

- **Feature Development**: Building and iterating on functionality
- **Architecture Analysis**: Deep-dive into system design and patterns
- **Service Documentation**: Detailed service architecture and implementation
- **Infrastructure Design**: Cloud architecture and deployment strategies
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshooting and optimization approaches

## 🏗️ Learning Journeys

### 🔹 Tenant Management App Journey
**A comprehensive property management solution showcasing architectural evolution and enterprise-level thinking**

**Journey Timeline:**
- **Foundation** (Oct 1): [Single-File Version →](/learning/full-stack%20development/python/tenant-management-app-singlefile/) *(Feature)*
- **Architecture Evolution** (Oct 3): [Modular Monolith →](/learning/architecture/tenant-management-modular-monolith/) *(Architecture)*
- **System Architecture** (Oct 5): [Modular Monolith Architecture →](/learning/architecture/tenant-management-system-architecture/) *(Architecture)*
- **Component Architecture** (Planned): [Component Deep-Dive →](/learning/architecture/tenant-management-component-architecture/) *(Service)*
- **Infrastructure** (Planned): [Cloud Deployment Strategy →](/learning/infrastructure/cloud/tenant-management-deployment/) *(Infrastructure)*
