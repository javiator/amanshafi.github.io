## Mermaid Diagram Color Palette

When creating Mermaid diagrams in blog posts, use the following modern color palette with `classDef` styling for consistency and visual distinction:

### Color Palette Definitions:

| Component Type | Color | Stroke | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend/Client** | `#4fc3f7` (Light Blue) | `#0277bd` (Dark Blue) | React components, web clients |
| **Backend/API** | `#66bb6a` (Green) | `#2e7d32` (Dark Green) | Spring Boot, controllers, services |
| **Database** | `#42a5f5` (Blue) | `#1565c0` (Dark Blue) | PostgreSQL, H2, data layer |
| **Infrastructure** | `#ff7043` (Orange) | `#d84315` (Dark Orange) | Docker, containers, infrastructure |
| **External Services** | `#ab47bc` (Purple) | `#6a1b9a` (Dark Purple) | Swagger, monitoring, external APIs |
| **Security** | `#ffcdd2` (Light Red) | `#d32f2f` (Dark Red) | Security components, authentication |
| **Performance** | `#c8e6c9` (Light Green) | `#388e3c` (Green) | Caching, optimization |
| **Testing** | `#e1bee7` (Light Purple) | `#8e24aa` (Purple) | Test components, validation |
| **Monitoring** | `#b3e5fc` (Light Blue) | `#0288d1` (Blue) | Health checks, metrics |
| **Documentation** | `#ffa726` (Orange) | `#ef6c00` (Dark Orange) | API docs, specifications |

### Usage Guidelines:
- **Frontend/Client**: Use for React components, web applications, user interfaces
- **Backend/API**: Use for server-side services, API endpoints, business logic
- **Database**: Use for data storage, databases, data persistence layers
- **Infrastructure**: Use for deployment, containers, infrastructure components
- **External Services**: Use for third-party integrations, external APIs
- **Security**: Use for authentication, authorization, security components
- **Performance**: Use for caching, optimization, performance-related components
- **Testing**: Use for test components, validation, quality assurance
- **Monitoring**: Use for observability, health checks, metrics collection
- **Documentation**: Use for API documentation, specifications, guides

### Mermaid classDef Styling Template:

```mermaid
%% Example diagram with classDef styling
graph TB
    subgraph "Frontend Layer"
        A[React Component]
        B[Web Client]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Layer"
        C[API Service]
        D[Controller]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        E[(Database)]
        F[Cache]
    end
    
    A --> C
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    
    %% Styling definitions
    classDef frontend fill:#4fc3f7,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef backend fill:#66bb6a,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    classDef database fill:#42a5f5,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    classDef external fill:#ab47bc,stroke:#6a1b9a,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    classDef infrastructure fill:#ff7043,stroke:#d84315,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    classDef security fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#d32f2f,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef performance fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef testing fill:#e1bee7,stroke:#8e24aa,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef monitoring fill:#b3e5fc,stroke:#0288d1,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef documentation fill:#ffa726,stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    
    %% Apply classes to components
    class A,B frontend
    class C,D backend
    class E,F database
```

### Implementation Notes:
- **Use classDef**: Always use `classDef` styling instead of theme variables for better control
- **Stroke Width**: Use `stroke-width:3px` for better visibility
- **Text Color**: Use `color:#000` for light backgrounds, `color:#fff` for dark backgrounds
- **Class Assignment**: Apply classes using `class ComponentName1,ComponentName2 className`
- **ER Diagrams**: Entity Relationship diagrams don't support classDef, use default styling

## Journey Linking Instructions

When creating new posts in a journey, always verify and update journey navigation:

### 1. **Check Previous Post Links**
- Ensure the previous post's `next_post` field points to your new post
- Update the previous post's `next_post` URL to match your new post's path

### 2. **Set Up New Post Navigation**
- Add proper `previous_post` field pointing to the previous post
- Set `next_post` field if you know the next planned post
- Use `null` for `next_post` if it's the latest post in the journey

### 3. **Update Journey Metadata**
- Ensure `journey_step` is sequential (increment from previous post)
- Verify `journey_phase` is appropriate for the content type
- Set `content_type` to match the post's focus
- Update `learning_focus` to reflect key learning areas

### 4. **Navigation Section Format**
```markdown
## 🚀 Journey Navigation
- **Previous**: [Previous Post Title →](/path-to-previous/)
- **Current**: Current Post Title
- **Next**: [Next Post Title →](/path-to-next/) *(Status)*
```

### 5. **Journey Continuity Checklist**
- [ ] Previous post links to this post
